Hi, I'm @adamhw27

I’m currently studying Computer Engineering at the University of Utah. I’m interested in aerospace systems, embedded programming, and systems engineering. I’ve worked on projects involving making my own tiny shell in C, LoRa-based weather balloon telemetry, implementing 16-bit RISC processor on an FPGA, and electrical systems for robotics. I’m also a TA for introductory ECE labs, helping students with circuit design, MATLAB, and breadboarding. Outside of engineering, I love playing guitar, skiing, and SCUBA diving.
